# Dogs vs Cats Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The CNN model is trained on a dataset containing thousands of images of dogs and cats, with the objective of accurately distinguishing between the two classes. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to create a robust classifier capable of identifying dogs and cats in images with high accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of dogs and cats. It is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the CNN model's performance. The dataset serves as the foundation for training the model to recognize distinct features of both dogs and cats.

## Key Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data to improve model generalization.
- **Model Architecture Design:** Building a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks, consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Model Training:** Training the CNN model on the training dataset to learn features that differentiate between dogs and cats.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment:** Deploying the trained model to classify new images of dogs and cats accurately.

## Tools and Technologies
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:
- **Python:** Programming language used for developing the CNN model and data preprocessing scripts.
- **TensorFlow:** Deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras:** High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, used for building the CNN architecture.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Visualization libraries used for visualizing images, model performance metrics, and training/validation curves.
